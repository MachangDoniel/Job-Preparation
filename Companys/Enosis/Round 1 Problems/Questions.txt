Problem 1:
In a school there is a room where n students will sit for an exam.
i'th student will sit for the exam from time s_i to t_i
If there're at least k students in the room, then we need an invigilator.

given q queries. For each query, you're given a time range l r.
Count the number of minutes where we need an invigilator.
Sample for problem 1:
N = 3
K = 2
2 9
3 5
7 8
q = 2
1 10 ans: 5
6 7 ans: 1

Problem 2:
S = deft 
K = 5
Ans: acft

S = qstd
K = 1000
Ans: aaaa

everything <= 1e6


problem 2:
arrange all characters a-z in a cycle.
Distance between two characters is the minimum distance if we travel one character to another clockwise or anticlockwise.
example: 
distance from 'a' to 'c' is 2
distance from 'a' to 'z' is 1

distance between two strings of length n is the sum of character by character difference.

given a string S of size n and K.
find the lexicographically smallest string T of size n such that distance between S and T does not exceed K.

mcq:

choose the option that is related to the fifth number the way 2nd number is realted to the 1st number and fourth number is related to the 3rd number.
52:5 :: 100:7 :: 164:

option

Problem 1:

There are given a set of words and M sentences. You can replace the words in sentence which is in the words set and replace with its anagram from the words set. For every sentence you have to find out how many ways we can change a sentence.

1 <= size of word <= 20
1 <= no of words in a sentence <= 20
1 <= M <= 1000

wordset = ['listen', 'it', 'is', 'silent']
sentence = "Iisten is silent".

Listen and Silent is anagram. So, we can rearrange the sentence in 4 ways.

listen is silent
silent is silent
listen is listen
silent is listen

Which word is odd:
1. Cessation
2. Closure
3. Intermission
4. Valediciton

Given an array of tokens.
Given a 2d array of requests.
2types of request=get,post.


If token doesn't contained in the token array, request is invalid.
If there is no csrf for post request, it is invalid.

input
tokens=["ajjajsjsskskks7","abcd',"xyz"]
requests=[["get","https://exampld.com/?token=aaaaa&name=rrrr"],
["get","https://exampld.com/?token=abcd&name=rrrr&location=kuet"],
["post","https://exampld.com/?token=abcd&csrf=asJ124Kii&name=rrrr&location=kuet&id=hiji"]]
["post","https://exampld.com/?token=abcd&name=rrrr&location=kuet&id=hiji"]]

Output
"INVALID"
"VALID,name,rrrr,location,kuet"
"VALID,name,rrrr,location,kuet,id,hiji"
"INVALID"

Problem 1:

You are given n points (1, 2, ... , n) and m segments. Each segments is already taken. No two segments overlap with each other. 
In a move you can take 2^x (x=0, 1, 2, .. ) continuous points (that is not already taken). Now, you have to count the minimum number of moves required to take all the points. 

Input Format: 
n m
l1 r1
l2 r2
.. ..
.. ..
.. ..
lm rm

Output Format: 
ans

Contraints: 
1<=n<=1e18
0<=m<=1e5
1<=li<=ri<=n

Sample input:
14 2
5 5

Problem 2:(repeatation of Emon's problem-1)

There are given a set of words and M sentences. You can replace the words in sentence which is in the words set and replace with its anagram from the words set. For every sentence you have to find out how many ways we can change a sentence.

1 <= size of word <= 20
1 <= no of words in a sentence <= 20
1 <= M <= 1000

Sample:

wordset = ['listen', 'it', 'is', 'silent']
sentence = "Iisten is silent".

Listen and Silent is anagram. So, we can rearrange the sentence in 4 ways.

listen is silent
silent is silent
listen is listen
silent is listen
