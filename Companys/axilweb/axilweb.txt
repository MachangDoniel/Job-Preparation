I have been working on Ostad (https://www.linkedin.com/company/ostad-inc/posts/?feedView=all) as a Teaching Assistant for 1 Month.
Currently, I am in the "Coding Interview Preparation" Course Invigilator in Ostad. I take support classes and prepare quizzes and assignments for course consumers.
I help them grow their problem-solving skills along with many side works on coding-related things.
Besides, I have vast experience on working on Laravel PHP, and have done some handsome web development projects using it.
I am also interested in App development using Swift for iOS and Java for Android.
Moreover, I am a contest programmer and have the honour of representing my university in some IUPCs and DIU ICPC 2024 securing good ranks on some of those.
